This code probably doesn't compile.  It probably doesn't do anything
you want to do.  It's probably full of bugs.

## Chording Keyboard Glove for Mobile Typing

_handwriting_ is code to impliment a chording keyboard on Arduino.  A
chording keyboard is one which sends different characters to the
computer depending on the combination of keys pressed. The table below
gives an example for the thumb and first finger, assuming no other
fingers are pressed:

| First | Thumb | Character |
|:-----:|:-----:|:---------:|
|       |       | None      |
|       |   X   | Space     |
|   X   |       | u         |
|   X   |   X   | s         |

The prototypes I'm building use sewable soft-circuit materials to
sense pressure on the fingertips of a glove.  There's more information
about the physical side of things
[in the blog post where I announced the project](http://www.teallabs.org/posts/2014-02-21-keyboard-glove-prototype.html).
